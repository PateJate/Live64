# Live64
A simulated 6510 environment with roughly C64-compatible hardware simulation.

## What's the appeal of Live64?
With Live64 you can not only write 6510 assembly code without having to constantly assemble it, you can also write using Live mode, which will execute the program as you're writing it, seeing what happens at the very line you're at. You can also send individual instructions without writing them into memory.

I'm also aiming to make it super easy for beginners to get into 6510 programming. The autocomplete and seeing what happens as you type helps a lot.

While you don't need it, you could do some fun stuff when you don't know what else to do. Or maybe you want to write a game for the C64? Who knows.

### You keep mentioning 6510... Why don't you say 6502?
6502 is very similar to 6510, but ever so slightly different. It's explained more in-depth on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6510). 

## Where/when can I get it?
Live64 will be available on this repository as soon as one can write a Hello World program on it.  

I do development on this project a few hours in a week, as it's just a hobby. I'd say it's about 50 % done now.  
Just give me a month or two. (written on Dec 15 2020)
## What will it run on?
It's mainly focused to run on Linux, using Qt.  
Support for Windows could maybe be worked on when I've released a fully working Linux build.

Support for Android and iOS (and Linux mobile OSes) could be to come at some point as well. I'm open to help in these areas!

## Is Live64 free?
Live64 will be free in price and also open source.

## Can I help or suggest something?
Probably! Contact me at askpatejate@gmail.com to know more.
